                Repairs are costly, both in time and money. The correct sequence of work will help to save both. Moreover, the more serious the alteration, the more opportunities to do something in parallel - for example, while waiting for the drying of one surface, perform other actions. When drawing up a repair plan, the question of priorities often arises: what is done first - the floor or the walls? Let's look into this.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                The basic principle used by almost all builders is from top to bottom, that is, first repair the ceiling, then the walls, then the floor. Most often this is due to the fact that mortars can get on horizontal surfaces and ruin the new coating.
                Moreover, if dismantling is implied, then you must first complete it - at this stage, the procedure is not regulated. Then there is a complex of rough finishing, then fine.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                It is not recommended to combine the stages of work with each other: for example, rough flooring and finishing - walls.
                But there are works in which the sequence may vary:
                if new interior partitions are installed to replace the old ones or redevelopment is implied;
                if you don’t want to lay out expensive wallpapers right on the screed before gluing;
                if there is no time to wait for the screed to dry completely.
              </p>

                “Cosmetics”, as a rule, includes something not global and decorative - wallpapering, painting surfaces, applying decorative plaster. If we are talking about flooring, then this is either the same painting, dust-free laying of laminate or linoleum flooring without leveling the base, and so on. Dismantling is best done all at once, regardless of what you decide to finish first - the floor or walls.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                Most often, the sequence is standard: first the walls are sheathed, then the floor. This is due to the fact that when working with chemical compositions (for example, impregnation, primer), you can stain the updated coating. And this is especially true when it comes to decorative plaster or when laying tiles.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                If you are spreading wallpaper on the floor for applying glue, we recommend underlaying polyethylene. This is especially important if the flooring is fresh: most adhesives, of course, are easily washed off with water, but, for example, laminate or natural wood does not need extra moisture.
