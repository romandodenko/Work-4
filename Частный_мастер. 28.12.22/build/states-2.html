A way to abstract from the dirtiest and most tedious stage of repair, saving time and nerve cells? Or a dubious prospect of remaking other people's "jambs"? Let's try to figure it out, weighing all the pros and cons.</p><p class="states__text">With a rough finish, everything is clear: we get only the harsh minimum necessary for the developer to be able to put the house into operation. As a rule, this is a floor screed, barely leveled walls, wiring to the apartment, radiators and double-glazed windows. In the case of fine finishing, we are already dealing with finishes, interior doors, plumbing, full electrical wiring, a meager set of sockets and lamps, as well as other people's tastes in choosing colors and materials. The pre-finishing finish is somewhere in the middle: no longer a concrete box, but not yet an interior with wallpaper.</p><p class="states__text">Developers offer different pre-finishing "packages". The standard option, as a rule, includes: aligned walls and ceiling, flooded screed, electrical wiring in the apartment, sockets, switches, double-glazed windows, front door, water supply and sewerage system. All that remains is decorating work: choosing the color of the walls and the shape of the tiles, and beautifully arranging the furniture. What is the catch and why do designers not like such apartments?</p></div></div><div class="states__item states__item_direction"><div class="states__descr"><p class="states__text">When choosing a prefinishing finish, you need to be prepared for a poor lighting scenario. Output under a single chandelier on the ceiling and an ascetic set of sockets - a standard "package" from the developer. There is also a chance of encountering an inconvenient outlet for plumbing. With such a base, it is usually difficult to create an ergonomic design interior. The minimum number and a certain location of sockets will begin to dictate the conditions for arranging furniture and will lead to extension cords spreading around the apartment.</p><p class="states__text">Opinions about the quality of materials from developers in new homes vary. Someone claims that it is unprofitable for the developer himself to use frankly budget materials that fall off before you have time to move in. Nobody wants to sue. The same applies to finishing without technical supervision and non-compliance with GOSTs.</p><p class="states__text">And someone is convinced that when decorating, developers save on everything, and technologies are violated, even if we are talking about premium class houses. You, at least, have to deal with curved walls, and the worst thing is with possible violations in the breeding of engineering systems. It's hard to say where the truth is.</p></div><div class="states__image"><img src="./img/states-2-2.png" alt="Image"></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__container container"><a class="footer__logo" href="main.html"><img src="./img/logo.png" alt="Image"> </a><a class="footer__phone" href="tel:2086869399"><svg width="25" height="25"><use xlink:href="./img/svg/sprites.svg#phone"></use></svg> +(208) 686-9399</a><ul class="footer__list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="terms.html">Terms and conditions</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="policy.html">Privacy policy</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="cookie.html">Cookie policy</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></body></html>
