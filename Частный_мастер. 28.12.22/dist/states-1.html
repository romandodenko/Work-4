                When clean styles dominated interior design, one of the popular trends was the so-called shabby chic.
                You probably still remember these decorative whitewashed interiors with an abundance of lace,
                papier-mâché and vintage. It was thanks to shabby that the interior fashion was overwhelmed by a wave of
                love for everything shabby and aged, especially if it is made of natural wood. And if the popularity of
                shabby chic is already in the past, and you can meet it only in the interiors of family cafes, then
                artificially aged wood is again relevant. What is the charm of this material and with what “neighbors”
                will it get along on the basis of a modern interior? We tell.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                The most popular way to give wood a heirloom look is brushing (from the English “brush” - a brush.) The
                bottom line is to remove the top layer of soft fibers from wooden surfaces, as the name implies, with a
                stiff brush. Having lost a soft layer, the wood takes on a relief and exposes the natural pattern of
                hard fibers. The result is fixed with oil, varnish or paint that mimics the natural tone of the wood
                species. To emphasize the relief, recesses and bulges can be tinted in different colors.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                Wood can also be given age by patination. It was this technique that was the main decorative tool in
                shabby interiors. This is done as follows: the paint is repeatedly applied to a wooden surface, and each
                new layer is partially removed to create the effect of paint worn off by time.
                These are the most popular, but far from the only ways to artificially age a tree. It is sanded with
                sandpaper, stained and even fired with a burner.

              <p class="states__text">
                If enthusiasm and manual dexterity allow, you can try to age the wooden surfaces yourself. Or choose a
                ready-made finishing material with the desired effect. The second option is preferable, because
                well-established production technologies make it possible to achieve the effect of antiquity, without
                actually reducing the life of the material.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                Artificial aging not only gives wood products a noble touch of antiquity, but also allows you to
                emphasize their naturalness. Interiors with this finish seem especially lived-in and visually warm.
                Aged wood in modern interiors can take furniture forms, appear on the ceiling as beams, be used for wall
                decoration, but is most often found on the floor in the form of a parquet board, giving the impression
                that more than one generation of residents walked on it.
              </p>
              <p class="states__text">
                Once upon a time, shabby interiors were assembled from stylized “ingredients that looked like they were
                rescued from grandmother's chests. Today, such stylization is no longer relevant, the fashionable focus
                has shifted to complex interiors, which are cramped within a certain style. In such spaces, the new is
                organically combined with the vintage, and in principle, an artificially aged board has no interior
                contraindications. But it still looks most organic in suburban spaces and apartments of the old fund.
                Aged wood can sit next to furniture and accessories from a variety of eras, but if you want to enhance
                the vintage effect, add neighbors such as copper, wood or earthenware, majolica-style ceramic tiles and
                forged products to it.
