            Note to travelers: how not to be embarrassed in different countries of the world
          </h1>
        <h2 class="about__subtitle">
          Greece
        </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            It would seem that friendly Greeks could come up with such a prohibition, striving to make sure that you remember your vacation for a long time. However, even in this sunny country there are certain rules, the violation of which does not bode well for you. So, for example, here it is not customary to gesticulate desperately (as in the same Italy) and it is considered completely bad manners to point your palm at someone. Such a gesture can be regarded as an insult followed by a showdown.
          </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            France
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            The loving French also distinguished themselves by their originality. For example, many of them deliberately pretend not to understand English (or any other) language and wait for you to try to say the same thing in their native language. Therefore, if you are planning a trip to this country, then learn a few basic phrases in advance (and at the same time a couple of compliments) to demonstrate your courtesy and get what you want from the locals.
          </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            Italy
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            Passionate Italians are also not as simple as it seems at first glance. In this country, you should also follow certain rules, unless, of course, you want your vacation to be hopelessly spoiled. For example, you will be fined 150 euros for being on the municipal beach from 1:00 am to 5:00 am, 1000 euros for busy but not used (you left your hat or umbrella on the beach early in the morning, went about your business and returned only in the evening) a place on the beach, 200 euros for smoking in a public place, 10 thousand euros for the purchase of fakes and counterfeit goods. In addition, it is customary here to address the interlocutor as “you”, hug him during a conversation or hold his hand, kiss even strangers as a sign of greeting or goodbye, and not leave tips in restaurants (as a rule, they are already included in the total bill).
          </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            Portugal
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            In this country, it is not customary to yawn and stretch in public places. In addition, you should not discuss your problems in public (especially those related to your family and children), compare the Portuguese with the Spaniards (they will be offended), catch and sell mussels and other shellfish, leave valuables on the beach or on the street, use a sound signal in towns and so on.
          </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            Great Britain
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            As for the stiff Great Britain, in this country, for example, raising your eyebrows will be regarded as an extremely skeptical attitude towards the interlocutor (therefore, watch your facial expressions and gestures, just in case). Clap each other on the shoulder in greeting, kiss a lady's hand, express your emotions passionately, raise two fingers (index and middle), with a "V" sign, smoke in public places (including restaurants and pubs), scandal and roundabout ways trying to bypass the queue here is also considered indecent and even offensive.
