            Touch screen, folding table and 3 more dirtiest things on planes that are better left untouched
          </h1>
          <p class="about__text">
            While everyone is discussing the revelations of a flight attendant of the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific, who spoke about the dangers of drinking various drinks on board an aircraft, in particular tea or coffee, for the preparation of which water of disgusting quality is used, which, accordingly, may not have the best effect on your well-being, the editors of Passion .ru decided to find out what other things on the plane are not as clean as it seems at first glance. We present the ranking of the most unsanitary items on board.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            According to the results of a study by American microbiologists, the dirtiest places on the plane were not toilets at all, as many might think, but completely different objects, on the surface of which the number of bacteria was several times greater than on the toilet rim (among almost three thousand microbes, for example , were found Serratia Plymuthica, causing damage to the respiratory tract, E. coli, Klebsiella, which provokes the appearance of pneumonia, damage to the mucous membranes, and others). So how can you protect yourself from harmful substances and not pick up some kind of "muck" during the flight? Let's figure it out together.
                    </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            Door leading to salon
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            Bacteria dangerous to the respiratory tract, E. coli, microbes that cause pneumonia and damage to the mucous membranes, which can lead, for example, to conjunctivitis, as well as other harmful microorganisms of three thousand different types that are unsafe for your health, were found on the surface of the door leading to salon. Therefore, try not to touch it once again, and even better - stock up on antibacterial wipes and a special gel to reduce the risk of possible infection.
          </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            Seat back pocket
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            One of the dirtiest places in an aircraft cabin can definitely be called a pocket located at the bottom of the back of an aircraft seat. And all because in addition to magazines and safety instructions, there you can find various garbage and trash left by passengers (food, used handkerchiefs and even diapers). The people responsible for the cleanliness of the aircraft do not prioritize the thorough cleaning of this particular "hotbed of germs", so the risk of catching some kind of infection (including stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea) is very high. Try to avoid contact with this item and be sure to wipe your hands with antibacterial wipes before doing any manipulations (for example, touching your face, scratching your nose or eyes, starting a meal, and so on).
          </p>
          <h2 class="about__subtitle">
            Folding table
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text">
            Another record holder for the number of harmful substances was a folding table, on the surface of which the degree of bacterial contamination of the environment exceeds 11 thousand units. Flight attendant Jamila Hardwick told the Daily Express that employees often simply do not have enough time to wipe down each individual table, so contact with this item can easily catch some kind of infection. To protect yourself, wipe the surface of the table with antibacterial wipes before and after use, and do not place unwrapped food on it. Following basic safety precautions will help you stay in good health and not ruin your flight experience.
