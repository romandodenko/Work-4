            Introvert rest: Turkish resorts where there are no crowds of tourists
          </h1>
          <p class="about__text">
            Turkey is a favorite holiday destination for many tourists. Warm clear sea, impressive nature, comfortable hotels, all-inclusive meals, a wide variety of excursions and entertainment - a paradise on earth where you can relax and not think about anything. But there are also disadvantages: crowds of tourists, crowded beaches, noisy companies, always screaming children, loud music and parties at night that make it difficult to fall asleep.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            Most tourists, when booking holidays in Turkey, choose resorts on the Mediterranean or Aegean Sea. The Black Sea in these parts is in less demand, and therefore, in addition to the fact that the rest here turns out to be quiet and calm, the prices for tours there are more affordable. Turkish resorts on the Black Sea have many advantages: mild, cool climate, semi-empty beaches, clear, transparent sea, fresh mountain air, green tea fields, many natural and historical attractions, thermal springs. The most comfortable period in terms of air and water temperature is July-August, the air temperature reaches +32, and the sea warms up to +26.

          <p class="about__text">
            There is an opinion in society that it is our people with a broad Russian soul who relax loudly and on a grand scale, but the Europeans are quieter and more cultured. If you want to relax in silence and change your circle of friends, then resorts where there are fewer Russians are suitable for you. As a rule, these resorts are those located at the furthest points from Antalya Airport, so be prepared for a long transfer to the hotel.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            There are three main resorts where mainly Europeans rest: <span>Oludeniz</span>, <span>Kusadasi</span>, <span>Fethiye</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text">
            All three resorts are located in picturesque places surrounded by mountains and green nature - coniferous and eucalyptus forests, the beaches here are clean and free, the water is blue and clear. Those who have vacationed in these places note a completely different attitude towards tourists than in Antalya and nearby resorts, you will be pleasantly surprised by the care of the staff and the attention of local residents.
